# Using Risk Management Tools

*Risk* is the likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability. A vulnerability is a weakness, and a threat is a potential danger.

A *threat* is a potential danger. Within the context of risk management, a threat is any circumstance or event that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or a system. *Threat assessment* helps an organization identify and categorize threats.

A *vulnerability* is a flaw or weakness in software or hardware, or a weakness in a process that a threat could exploit, resulting in a security breach.

*Risk management* is the practice of identifying, monitoring, and limiting risks to a manageable level. It doesn’t eliminate risks, but instead identifies methods to limit or mitigate them. The amount of risk that remains after managing risk is residual risk. The techniques used to mitigate risks are:
1. **Avoid** : Risk can be avoided by not using or providing services which can be risky.
2. **Transfer** : Risk can be transferred/shared by using insurance. 
3. **Mitigate** : Controls can be used to mitigate and reduce risks. 
4. **Accept** : If the cost of control outweights the cost of risk, the organisation accepts the risk.


## Risk Assessment

A risk assessment, or risk analysis, is an important task in risk management. 
1. Quantify and qualify risks based on different values of assets.
2. Identify threats and vulnerabilities, determine likelihood of exploitation and identify impact of threats.
3. Make recommendations for what controls to implement.

### Quantitative Risk Assessment
Here the risk is measured according to its monetary value which helps in prioritizing risks.

The following are used to identify quantitative risks:
* Single loss expectancy (SLE). The SLE is the cost of any single loss.
* Annual rate of occurrence (ARO). The ARO indicates how many times the loss will occur in a year. 
* Annual loss expectancy (ALE). The ALE is the value of SLE × ARO.

The cost helps identifying whether the risk should be mitigated or accepted.

### Qualitative Risk Assessment
Here the risk is judged on the basis of likelihood of the occurence and impact. These assessments are based on judgements and not pure numbers. 

Risks which have high impact and high occurences are more likely to have better mitigations in place. 

### Risk Registers

Risk registers are used to record all risk present. They might include:
* Category
* Specific Risk
* Likelihood of occurence
* Impact
* Risk Score
* Security controls or mitigation steps
* Contingencies
* Risk score with security controls
* Action assigned
* Action deadline

### Supply Chain Assessment

A supply chain assessment evaluates these elements—the raw materials supply sources and all the processes required to create, sell, and distribute the product.
